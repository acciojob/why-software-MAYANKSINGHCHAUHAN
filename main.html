    <h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
    
    <p>
        My passion for software development stems from a deep curiosity about how technology shapes our world. From a young age, I was fascinated by how software could solve complex problems, streamline processes, and create innovative solutions. 
        The ability to build applications that impact people's lives drives me to continuously learn and improve my skills. I enjoy problem-solving, logical thinking, and bringing ideas to life through coding. 
        Becoming a developer allows me to be a part of an ever-evolving industry that challenges me to grow and innovate every day.
